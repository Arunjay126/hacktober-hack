  <h1>A Header</h1>
    <span>
    These pages are intended to be explored in the 
    developer console of your browser.
    </span>
    <p>
    A paragraph of text.
    Whatever line wrapping that is present in the
    file                                   or lots
    of extra spaces in the file are generally ignored
    and the text is re-wrapped based on the width 
    of browser.
    </p>
        <p>You can add a style like <strong>bold</strong>
        to some text by enclosing it in the <em>appropriate</em>
        tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can even mark some text so that it is a 
        <a href="lists.htm">link to another page</a>.
    </p>
    <div>
    <p>
    If you        use the pre tag
       The browser respects spaces
    and
    line
    ends
            and shows the text in a
            monospace font.

    </div>
    <ul>
      <li><p>This pages shows us how 
      lists work</p></li>
      <li><p>We need to encode
      </p></li>
      <li><p>We should learn more about
